This project uses a PyTorch-based deep learning model to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images. The model is trained on labeled X-ray images to classify whether a patient has pneumonia or not. It leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to automatically extract relevant features from the images, such as patterns in the lungs, and then makes predictions. The model can help assist medical professionals in early and accurate detection of pneumonia.
